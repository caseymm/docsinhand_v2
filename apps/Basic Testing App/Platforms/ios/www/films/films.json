It lies at the southern end of a geological trough known as Walker Lane, which runs north into Oregon.

The eastern end of the left lateral Garlock Fault intersects the Death Valley Fault. Furnace Creek and the Amargosa River flow through the valley but eventually disappear into the sands of the valley floor.",
