            <p>The series, set in the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos at the end of a decade-long summer, interweaves several plot lines. The first follows the members of several noble houses in a civil war for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms; the second covers the rising threat of the impending winter and the mythical creatures of the North; the third chronicles the attempts of the exiled last scion of the realm's deposed dynasty to reclaim the throne. Through its morally ambiguous characters, the series explores issues of social hierarchy, religion, civil war, sexuality, crime and punishment.</p>

            <h1>King's Landing</h1>
            <img src="images/kingslanding.jpg" style="width:100%;" />

            <p><strong>King's Landing</strong> is the capital of the Seven Kingdoms, located on the east coast of Westeros, overlooking Blackwater Bay. It is the site of the Iron Throne and the Red Keep, the seat of the King. The main city is surrounded by a wall, manned by the City Watch of King's Landing, also known as the Gold Cloaks. Poorer smallfolk build shanty settlements outside the city. King's Landing is extremely populous, but rather unsightly and dirty compared to other cities. The stench of the city's waste can be smelled far beyond its walls. It is the principal harbor of the Seven Kingdoms, rivaled only by Oldtown.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>The area around King's Landing used to be disputed territory between the Kingdoms of the Reach, River and Stormlands, just hills and forests, with only a handful of fisherfolk living north of the Blackwater Rush â€“ until three hundred years ago, when Aegon the Conqueror landed at the mouth of the Blackwater Rush, building his first fortress of wood and earth, on top of the highest hill. Later, when Aegon finalized his conquest, he decided to build his capital around that fort, since it was more centrally located than any other and not part of any of the former kingdoms, setting the king apart from his vassals.      </p>
            <p>In time, the city was expanded by the Targaryen kings. The Red Keep was completed during the reign of Maegor the Cruel, The Great Sept was built to show the Targaryens' piety and adherence to the Faith of the Seven after giving up the old gods of Valyria (it was not named the Great Sept of Baelor until after Baelor the Blessed's death), and the Dragonpit was constructed to house the Targaryen dragons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </p>
            <p>King's Landing has suffered occasional attacks and catastrophes during its existence. During the Blackfyre Rebellion, the Army of the bastard half-brother of King Daeron II threatened the City, but was promptly stopped at the Battle of the Redgrass Field. During the Great Spring Sickness, four in ten inhabitants were killed by the outbreak and funeral pyres in the Dragonpit had burnt nonstop, painting the night sky in the unnatural green of wildfire. Most notably, during the civil war known as Robert's Rebellion, the Mad King Aerys contemplated burning the city to the ground to "save" it from the rebels, and it was shortly after sacked by a Lannister host.

            <h1>Winterfell</h1>
            <img src="images/winterfell.jpg" style="width:100%;" />

            <p><strong>Winterfell</strong> is the ancestral castle and seat of power of House Stark and is considered to be the capital of the North. It is located in the center of the northern province of the Seven Kingdoms, on the Kingsroad that runs from King's Landing to the Wall.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>It was supposedly built by Brandon the Builder over eight thousand years ago, with the help of giants.[1] For most of recorded history Winterfell was the seat of House Stark, the Kings in the North and later as Wardens of The North, after King Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror and his dragons. As the regional capital of the North, harvest festivities have been hosted in Winterfell for centuries.
            During the War of the Five Kings, Winterfell, was captured in a surprise attack by the ironmen led by Theon Greyjoy. Theon ruled the castle for several weeks, but he lacked the manpower to hold it indefinitely against the Stark bannermen. The castle was sacked and burned by Ramsay Snow, after his force of Dreadfort men turned on his fellow northmen and double-crossing Theon, taking him prisoner. It was later partially restored by the Boltons in preparation for the wedding of the "Arya Stark".</p>

            <h3>Layout</h3>

            <p>Winterfell is a huge castle complex spanning several acres, consisting of two massive walls and a village located just outside called the "winter town".[2] Winterfell itself has been built around an ancient godswood and over natural hot springs. The water is piped through walls and chambers to heat them, making Winterfell more comfortable than other castles during the harsh northern winter.</p>
            <p>Inside the walls, the complex is composed of dozens of courtyards and small open spaces. Weapons training and practice take place in those yards. The inner ward is a second, much older open space in the castle where archery practice takes place. It is located next to the broken tower. Inside Winterfell stands the Inner Castle, which contains the Great Keep and the Great Hall.</p>

            <h1>The Wall</h1>
            <img src="images/wall.jpg" style="width:100%;" />

            <p><strong>The Wall</strong> is a massive wall over 700 feet high and is made of ice, stretching 300 miles across the northern border of the Seven Kingdoms, separating it from the wild lands beyond and is regarded as one of the nine Wonders Made by Man. The Wall is defended and held by the Sworn Brothers of the Night's Watch, who patrol and guard the castles from the Frostfangs Mountain range in the west to the Bay of Seals in the east.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>The Wall was reputedly created over 8,000 years prior to the present setting by Brandon the Builder after the Long Night to defend the realms of man from the wildlings and Others. Approximately 300 miles in length and 700 feet in height, the Wall is protected by the Night's Watch and according to some, ancient spells and sorcery.[1] Supposedly, Brandon the Builder had placed his foundations along the heights wherever possible.[2] Several mentions in the text suggest that the Wall was much smaller at the time, having been built upon by the Night's Watch builders, who quarried huge blocks of ice from frozen lakes in the haunted forest and dragged them south to make the Wall higher, raising it over the centuries to its present size. However, the severely reduced Night's Watch at the present time is limited to maintenance duty. A total of nineteen fortresses have been built along the Wall though only three, The Shadow Tower, Castle Black and Eastwatch-by-the-sea are occupied at the time of the books.</p>

            <h1>Pentos</h1>
            <img src="images/pentos.jpg" style="width:100%;" />

            <p><strong>Pentos</strong> is one of the Free Cities. It is a port located on the western coast of Essos.</p>

            <h3>City</h3>

            <p>Pentos is a large port city, more populous than Astapor on Slaver's Bay, and may be one of the most populous of the Free Cities.[1] It lies on a bay off the narrow sea, with the Flatlands plains and Velvet Hills to the east.</p>
            <p>The city has many square brick towers, controlled by the spice traders.[2] Most of the roofing is done in tiles. There is a large red temple in Pentos, along with the manse of Illyrio Mopatis[3] and the 'Sunrise Gate' allows the traveler to exit the city to the east, in the direction of the Rhoyne.[4]</p>

            <h3>Ruler</h3>

            <p>Pentos is a city where wealth equals power, ruled over by a prince with a council of magisters. The prince has a mostly ceremonial function while the rich magisters rule.</p>
            <p>The prince is chosen from the forty families, and presides chiefly over balls and feasts. Three heralds travel with him: the golden scales of trade, the iron sword of war and the silver scourge of justice. On the first day of every new year, the Prince must deflower the maid of the fields and the maid of the seas. When the Pentoshi believe the gods are angry at them, such as after loss in a war or a crop failure, they sacrifice the prince by cutting his throat to appease the gods and then choose a new prince from amongst the forty families.[3]</p>

            <h3>People</h3>

            <p>There are laws forbidding slavery in the city, in accordance with the terms imposed by Braavos one hundred years ago.[3] This, however, does not stop the wealthy magisters from keeping many bronze-collared "servants", who are slaves in all but name.[3]</p>
            <p>Like the Braavosi, and Lysene, Pentoshi are great lovers of song, and generous with those who please them.[5] Some of their men dye, oil, and fork their beards.[6]</p>
            <p>Some of the more famous Pentoshi include Magister Illyrio Mopatis and the Tattered Prince, a sellsword captain.</p>
